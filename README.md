# Mini-Calender


###🗓️ Presenting my Mini Calendar Project with JavaScript Integration! 📅

Check out this adorable mini calendar I created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's a simple yet stylish way to display the date dynamically.


Here's how it works:

Dynamically updates to display the current month, day, weekday, and year using JavaScript.
Designed with a sleek red theme on a clean white background.
Perfect for adding a touch of charm to any webpage or application.
